## Project Description 


## Data Model
 I am the owner/operator of a tennis club called "Ace Haven Tennis Club." Our club is located in a suburban area of a medium-sized city, and we offer a variety of tennis-related services and activities to our members. We have both recreational and competitive tennis programs, and we host tournaments  and events throughout the year. Our goal is to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for tennis enthusiasts of all ages and skill levels.
 
Our tennis club has a membership system, coaching services, court rentals, and a pro shop where members can purchase tennis equipment and apparel. We also have a cafe and lounge area for socializing and relaxation. We are proud of our vibrant tennis community, and we want to improve the overall experience for our members, coaches, and staff through the implementation of a robust relational database.
To provide you with more information about our organization, here are some key aspects that the MIST 4610 class students should consider when building the database:

Members: We have a diverse membership base with different types of memberships (e.g., individual, family, student). Each member has a unique ID, contact information, and payment history. Some members may have specific preferences or requirements, such as coaching programs or court reservations.

Coaching Services: We offer coaching services with various coaches, each with their own specialization and availability. Coaches have profiles, schedules, and qualifications. Members can book coaching sessions, and we need to track these bookings and payments.
Court Reservations: Members can book tennis courts for specific dates and times. We need to manage court availability, reservations, and any fees associated with court bookings.

Tournaments and Events: We host tennis tournaments and events throughout the year. These events have specific dates, locations, and categories. Onlyst participants can register for these events, and we need to keep track of their registration status and payments.

Pro Shop: We sell tennis equipment and apparel in our pro shop. We need to track inventory, sales, and customer purchases.

Cafe and Lounge: The cafe and lounge offer food and beverages. We want to keep a record of orders and payments made by our members and guests.

Staff: We have a team of employees, including coaches, front desk staff, and cafe employees. Each employee has a profile with contact information, employment history, and schedule.

Financial Records: We need to manage financial records, including membership fees, coaching fees, court rental fees, event registration fees, and expenses related to staff salaries and inventory.

Maintenance and Repairs: Tennis courts and equipment require maintenance and occasional repairs. Create an entity to track maintenance schedules, repair requests, costs, and the status of maintenance tasks.

Membership Renewals: Keep track of when memberships are due for renewal, send reminders to members, and manage the renewal process. This entity should include renewal dates and payment history.
